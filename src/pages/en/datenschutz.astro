					</p>
					<p>
						IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING.

					<p>
						In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Right to Data Portability</h3>
					<p>
						You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
					<p>
						This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
					</p>
					<p>
						If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
					<p>
						You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time regarding this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
						<li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
						<li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
						<li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
						<li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
