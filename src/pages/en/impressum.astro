					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Liability for Content</h3>
					<p>
						The contents of our pages have been created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws pursuant to § 7 para. 1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law.
